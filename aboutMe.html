            Describing oneself can be such a daunting task to accomplish, but also quite fulfilling. With all the knowledge and information, we know about ourselves, it can be quite tricky to put everything into words. I believe that
            being self-aware helps greatly, as we would be able to include all your attributes, may it be positive or negative which makes our composition more authentic and genuine.

        <p class = "content">I finished my Bachelor in Computer Science studies. From there I continued learning every day, through personal attainment
          and from the careers I have practiced. At 16 years of age, I have already travelled to a lot of places, places I have only dreamt of as a kid. The road
          was certainly not paved smoothly all the way through, but I can say that having good family support helps immensely.</p>

        <p class = "content">As a young adult I was bold and adventurous, I wanted to try, explore, and experience all the world has to offer. Because of that, I have
        acquired quite a few hobbies namely, Muay Thai, pole dancing and make-up artistry. I even had a computer shop as a business when I was 22 years old. I also took up swimming lessons as an adult, to further better
      myself in general. Hiking up different mountains was also a favourite past time, the one in Sagada, Mountain Province being the most memorable, because this is where it all started, it was where I fell in love with hiking.</p>

      <p class = "content">In the future, it would be a dream if I could add more on to what I have mentioned above. I believe that the more we experience different
      things as an individual, allows us to grow and be more open-minded regarding different cultures and traditions that we may encounter in the
      near future. I truly value the gift of education, therefore even up till now, I still go out my way to try and learn new things. Improving my knowledge at
      every expense and absorbing all the learnings that might be thrown my way is truly my favourite past time of all.</p>  
    
      <p class = "content">
        Now, I am living in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. I have a stable job, and currently enjoying what life has to offer. Just recently, I have finally
        become an Australian Citizen after 7 years of living here. Every day, I meet new people who become my companions and friends, some may
        even be for life. Being an extrovert, I enjoy social gatherings and night outs, constantly making memories I will never forget whilst learning and having fun.

        To put my whole life into a text would take 12 volumes of 500 paged books to finish. Therefore, having this excerpt of my life story for me tell is
      extremely rewarding. My life as a child was easier because of my family, which I am thankful for. As a young adult I truly had the best memories in
      my life, all the new and first experiences are embedded in my mind forever. Now, having stability in life truly promotes my eagerness to further learn
    and educate myself. As an individual, I love being in situations that challenge my comfort, because I believe in the saying according to Bryant
    H. McGill who is a human potential thought leader, international bestselling author, activist, and social entrepreneur,
